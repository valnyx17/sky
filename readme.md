# valnyx's neovim config

made from scratch with a minimalism philosphy applied.

For any functionality needed:

1. if there's an inbuilt solution with enough features, use it.
2. if there's a way to make it using a small bit of lua code, write said lua code.
  a. for example, a "presentation" mode can be made by wrapping a TUI presentation program with a neovim terminal.
3. if the above are not true, and there's a fast, popular, well-maintained plugin, use it instead.
